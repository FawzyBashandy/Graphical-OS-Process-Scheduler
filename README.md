# Process Scheduler GUI in Java

This project is a **Graphical CPU Scheduler Simulator** that visualizes how the **Shortest Job First (SJF)** algorithm schedules tasks in an operating system. Built using Java Scene builder, it provides an interactive graphical interface for adding processes and observing how they are scheduled in a Gantt chart.

The tool is designed not only as a simulation of SJF but also as a **foundation for building more advanced real-time scheduling visualizers**. With its modular structure, developers can extend it to simulate and visualize:
- Real-time scheduling algorithms like Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) or Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
- Preemptive versions of SJF or Priority Scheduling
- OS-level resource management scenarios

This makes it an excellent educational tool for operating systems students and a strong base for research-oriented scheduling experiments.
This project is a **Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer**, built using **Java Schene Builder**. It allows users to input processes, calculate scheduling, and visualize the resulting **Gantt chart** dynamically.

## üöÄ Features

- GUI interface to input and manage processes
- Implements **SJF (non-preemptive)** scheduling algorithm
- Visualizes the schedule using a custom Gantt chart
- Displays detailed process timing in a table
- Modular and extensible object-oriented design
